A project for a course called COMP3111, It scrapes data from a website and uses the data for further purposes such as finding average, lowest, and highest price.

Note:
1. We have a folder called JavaDoc where we have all the java doc files.
2. Pleas bear with us because the building the Test for test coverage might take time as it has 11 Tests (Estimated time is 3mins or more), Thanks.
